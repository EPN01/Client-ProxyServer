In this client/proxy server model,the client orders the proxy server to reach a destination website through its ip.First the client socket binds with the server('127.0.0.6) and port (12000) which the proxy server already connected to.Then the client performs a get request to be encoded and sent to the proxy server through the connection socket.The proxy server decodes the incoming request, and parses it to obtain the destination ip.Next, the proxy server now acts as the client with respect to the destination server which the proxy binds to using the desetination ip and port numbber 80 which is used for webservers. So the proxy will encode and send the request to the destination server which will recieve,decode,and send back the response.Finally,the proxy will send back the response to the client through the connection socket and all sockets are closed.
